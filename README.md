# My NixOS config
This is where I store the config files and dotfiles for my NixOS setup. I'm new to Nix in general, so there's a lot of tinkering and experimentation happening in this space.
A lot of it is still very noob-ish, so if you stumble on this repo and have any advice, I'd love to hear it!
